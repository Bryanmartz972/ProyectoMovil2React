# Prometheus Mobile App 
This is an mobile app elaborated for the class of Mobile Programming 2. This is the first mobile app that I made with React Native.  This project was made by a team of 3 people led by me.
This mobile app was elaborated for a fictional store that sells workout and exercising clothing called Prometheus.

## Description of the project
This project was elaborated with Javascript, React Native and Expo. 

This React Native app was connected to an API that we also made for storing and collecting the data from the MySQL database running locally. We also made another similar app for the employee of the store, which he or she can add new products, restock inventory and delete or modify products on sale. Here are the links for the repositories:
- React Native API: https://github.com/Bryanmartz972/ProyectoMovil2
- React Native employee application: https://github.com/Bryanmartz972/ProyectoMovil2ReactUsuario   


## Features

- Login and Signin to the app
- Buying products from the app
- Searching of products
- User shopping cart


## Installation
For trying the project locally on your computer, either clone the repository or download the .zip folder and extract it in any folder you like.
Once you have the project, with Visual Studio Code terminal or any other Bash program (like Git Bash) run the following commands:

```bash
  npm i // For installing dependencies
  expo start // For running the project.

```
For trying out the project:
- You have to execute the API first for it to show data
- You have to change your IP address in every file that another IP address is shown 

When you change all that, you can open the app by installing the "Expo Go" app on your phone and connecting to the app via QRCode by opening the web dev tools for Expo in the terminal with the 'W' key.
